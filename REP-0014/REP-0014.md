## Abstract

This proposal specifies the activation of London features on Ronin. 

## Rationale

The process of incorporating changes allows Ronin to introduce new features in Ethereum. With this REP, our intention is to enhance our network by integrating a selection of EIPs.

## Specification

This REP includes the following EIPs:

- [EIP-1559: Fee market change](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)
- [EIP-3198: BASEFEE opcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198)
- [EIP-3529: Reduction in refunds](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3529)
- [EIP-3541: Reject new contract code starting with the 0xEF byte](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541)

Regarding EIP-1559, we intend to set the base fee to 0. This means that apart from the format, EIP-1559 transactions will be the same as legacy transactions. Moving forward, we can engage in further discussions to adapt EIP-1559 to align with Ronin's economic.


## Security analysis

The new feature does not affect the security of Ronin.
