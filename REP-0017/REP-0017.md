## Abstract

REP-0017 describes the process of reverting the slashing rules to the original state. When Ronin first moved to DPOS, the slashing rules were changed to be more forgiving, announcement post [here](https://discord.com/channels/930892666705694800/930895348921163786/1094568140593168394), for those unable to see the link, check the image included in this directory.


## Rationale

With the migration from Standard Validators (SVs) to Rotating Validators (RVs) it becomes more important than ever to have strict rules with regards to slashing. The changes to the rules to make them more forgiving made sense when we were starting on DPoS as it allowed us to have more of a room for error with new software. The risks caused by forgiving slashing rules were mitigated by the limit of only 10 SVs being allowed combined with an incredibly high barrier of entry to become one of the SVs (upwards of 8 million RON). With the change to RVs, the barrier for entry is now 1/32 as difficult. I believe that increasing the slashing rules would act as a good deterrent to stop users that should not be running a node (due to lack of technical knowledge).

## Specification

**1/Unavailability validator rules**<br>
